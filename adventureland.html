            <h2> Overview</h2>
            <p>
                Adventureland is one of the origninal lands from the opening of Disneyland on July 17, 1955. Home to classic rides and experiences along with one thrilling ride, Adventureland is a great stop for the whole family!

            <h2> Rides and Shows </h2>
            </p>
                Adventureland is home to two rides and one show. The Enchanted Tiki Room is a fun show that can serve as a great break in the air-conditioned room. Listen to the birds sing words and the flowers croon, but be warned - like It's a Small World, this show will get stuck in your head. While I do not think it should be a top priority, the Tiki Room can be a fun interlude during your Disney Day.
            </p>
            <p>
                Home of the worst puns in the park, Jungle Cruise is a classic attraction that anyone can enjoy. Jungle Cruise takes you "around the world," with your skipper offering his "insights and experience" in a way that will draw a laugh from just about anyone. Lines can get up to 45 minutes sometimes, so definitely check the Disneyland App to make sure you do not get caught in a long line, but most of the time waits should not exceed 30 minutes. 
            </p>
            <p>
                The last ride and "anchor" for the land is Indiana Jones Adventure. Themed after the iconic Harrison Ford movies, Indiana Jones Adventure can be rough and thrilling, and it is a definite enjoyment for those who seek a higher-thrill day at Disneyland. It is also a great ride for kids who are just starting to get into thrill rides, so take advantage of it!

            <h2> Food and Drink </h2>
            <p>
                Adventureland is home to four spots to get food: Tropical Hideaway, the Tiki Juice Bar, Tropical Imports, and Bengal Barbecue. Tropical Imports offers some fresher snacks like apple slices, mangos, and pickles, so it is a good spot for those looking to avoid all those calories in a churro or popcorn. On the flip side, the Tiki Juice Bar offers the Disney Classic: the Dole Whip. For some, no trip to Disney is complete without a Dole Whip. I don't often get one, but to each their own. I would definitely recommend it if you need a sweet treat to cool you down on a hot day. Bengal Barbecue offers variations of meat skewers and kabobs, and it is an easy and affordable meal for those looking to eat in the park less expensively. The food also tastes pretty good! Finally, Tropical Hideaway is realtively new, replacing Aladdin's Oasis in the corner of Adventureland. It is a great place to grab some unique snacks, such as some interesting Bao Buns and Lumpia. The food is always tasty there, and it is good stop for a fun snack!

            <h2> Tips and Tricks </h2>
            <p>
                Many Disneyland guides will tell you to ride Indiana Jones Adventure first. I disagree with a caveat - as long as you are willing to break up your party, ride Indiana Jones using the Single Rider queue. If you are not willing to break up your party, you should probably ride it early because its Fastpass line does not take much time off the total wait time. Additionally, don't forget to order your food through the Disneyland App! Mobile ordering will save you so much time, esepecially if you want that Dole Whip!
