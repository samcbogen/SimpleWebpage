        <h2> Overview</h2>
        <p>
            Welcome to Sam Bogen's Basic Guide to Disneyland Park. As of now, this guide will take you through the basics of three lands in Disneyland Park -- <a href="fantasyland.html">Fantasyland</a>, <a href="starwars.html"> Star Wars: Galaxy's Edge</a>, and <a href="adventureland.html">Adventureland</a> -- giving you information about the land's rides, shows, and food options. Eventually, this website may be updated to include information about more lands at Disneyland Park, California Adventure, and Downtown Disney District. 
        </p>
        <p>
            In this webpage, I will tell you about what I enjoy at the parks, some of my tips and tricks to get as much done as you can, and how to plan your day in advance. I grew up loving Disneyland (and still love it today), and I want to make sure everyone can have the same amazing, magical experiences that I do each time I go to the parks!
        </p>

        <h2> About Me </h2>
        </p>
            I am a current sophomore at <a href="https://www.cmc.edu/">Claremont McKenna College</a> in Southern California. I typically visit Disneyland Resort between 15 and 25 times per year, and I have done this since 2005. I have ridden every ride, seen every show, and eaten at (almost) every restaurant on property. I look forward to sharing my experience with you so I can help you as you embark on your visit to Disneyland Resort! Besides visiting Disneyland as much as I can, I compete in Model United Nations for <a href="https://www.cmcmun.com/">CMCMUN</a>!
